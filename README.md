# Network Scanner

A simple network scanner written in C++ that checks for open ports within a specified range on a target host.

## Features

- Scans a range of ports on a target IP address.
- Multithreaded for improved performance.
- Prints the list of open ports in a table format.
- Provides a count of open and closed ports.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Linux-based operating system (e.g., Kali Linux)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-scanner.git

## Compile the source code:

  ```bash
g++ network_scanner.cpp -o network_scanner
  ```
## Run the program:

```bash
./network_scanner
```

Enter the target IP address and the range of ports to scan when prompted.

Wait for the scanning process to complete. The program will display the open ports in a table format and provide a summary of the scan results.
