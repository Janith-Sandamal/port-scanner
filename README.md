# Port Scanner üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A simple port scanner written in C++ that checks for open ports within a specified range on a target host.

## Features

- **Multithreaded Scanning:** Concurrently scans multiple ports using threads for faster scanning.
- **Range of Ports:** Allows you to specify a range of ports to scan for the target IP address.
- **Open Port Detection:** Detects and displays the open ports found during the scan.
- **Scan Summary:** Provides a summary of the scan results, including the number of open and closed ports.

## Libraries Used

- `iostream`: Provides input/output streams functionality.
- `string`: Enables string manipulation and operations.
- `vector`: Implements dynamic arrays (vectors) and provides related functions.
- `thread`: Supports multithreading and manages concurrent execution.
- `mutex`: Provides a synchronization primitive (mutex) to protect shared resources.
- `chrono`: Offers functions to measure time durations and delays.
- `sys/socket.h`: Includes socket-related functions and structures.
- `arpa/inet.h`: Contains functions for manipulating IP addresses and network operations.
- `unistd.h`: Provides access to POSIX operating system API.


## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Linux-based operating system (e.g., Kali Linux)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Janith-Sandamal/port-scanner.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd port-scanner
```

3. Compile the source code:

  ```bash
g++ portScanner.cpp -o portScanner
  ```
4. Run the program:

```bash
./portScanner
```

Enter the target IP address and the range of ports to scan when prompted.

Wait for the scanning process to complete. The program will display the open ports in a table format and provide a summary of the scan results.
<br>

<pre>
Enter the target IP address: 192.168.1.1
Enter the range of ports to scan start : 1 
Enter the range of ports to scan end : 1000

----- Open Ports -----
Port    Status
22      Open
80      Open
443     Open

Scan Summary:
Open Ports: 3
Closed Ports: 997
